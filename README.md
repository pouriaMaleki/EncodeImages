the project under develop a predictive encoding and a lossless encoding algorithm to 
apply on image data in order to obtain a code-word with reduced bitrate. A reverse process is 
carried out on the decoder side to reconstruct the original image in MATLAB.

This repo is just a test for finding ideas in image code and decoding!
